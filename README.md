# üè´ Campus Voting Website

Democracy is at the heart of every civilization, and for this reason it is one of the most targeted areas by criminal masterminds and power addicts of our modern wold. However, the recent rise of blockchain technology, more specifically the Internet Computer has given everyone the power to own and control their own data. Campus voice is a web3 application built on the Internet Computer using React, Tailwind CSS and the Juno toolkit. With Campus Voice the voting ledger is stored directly in the Internet's Computer blockchain making it immutable. This not only makes the application credible and reliable but also fast and cheap due to the Internet's Computer low gas fees.
